        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 300-level student in the Computer Science department, where I am gaining solid knowledge in programming, algorithms, and computer systems. My course has helped me understand how technology can be used to solve real-world problems and has strengthened my logical and analytical thinking skills. I am particularly interested in software development and emerging technologies, and my goal is to become a skilled tech professional who develops efficient and impactful digital solutions.
            <br><br>
            Throughout my studies, I learned the importance of problem-solving, continuous learning, and practical application of theoretical knowledge. Writing and debugging code taught me patience and attention to detail, while group tasks improved my teamwork and communication skills.
            <br><br>
            One of the major challenges I faced was understanding complex programming concepts and managing time effectively between coursework and practice. Some topics required extra effort and repeated practice to fully understand. To overcome these challenges, I made use of online learning resources, practiced consistently, and sought guidance from lecturers and classmates whenever I encountered difficulties.
            <br><br>
            Overall, my experience in the Computer Science department has been both challenging and rewarding. It has improved my confidence, sharpened my technical skills, and increased my passion for technology. The journey has motivated me to keep learning, improving, and working toward a successful career in the tech industry.
